1, before main node,A01,How do you feel?,How are you feeling today?
2, before main node,A02,Can I know if the predicted emotion is correct?,Do I guess your emotion correctly?
3, before main node,A03,Is the emotion positive or negative?,
4, before main node,A04,Let us practice Exercise 13 to overcome negative emotions.,
5, before main node,A05,Do you feel compassionate toward your childhood self?,
6, before main node,A06,"Amazing! Do you feel you want to protect your childhood self, or do you think that it is time for your childhood self to grow up and face hardships?",
7, before main node,A07,"Congratulations! You have shown tender compassion. Tender compassion is the first phase of compassion, where you feel sympathy towards the victim. You feel for the victim, hoping to do something that can help alleviate the suffering of the victim immediately.",
8, before main node,A08,"Congratulations! You have shown foresighted compassion to your childhood self. Contrary to tender compassion which is an immediate form of sympathy towards the victim, you have shown foresighted compassion which helps you think about how to help the victim long-term!",
9, before main node,A09,"Now, it is time to bring compassion to the next level. Please take SAT module later to help you develop foresighted compassion! Foresighted compassion aims to help you develop long-term solutions that can help victims by facing the suffering and growing from there. Let's go further!",
10, before main node,A10,"Now it is time for you to use your compassion energy to do meaningful things in the real world! At the MAIN NODE, please go to Awareness, Understanding, Commitments (AUC) to start making an impact in the real world!",
11,sat part 1,B01,"Before we start, note that the main purpose of using this chatbot is to develop compassion. ",
12,sat part 1,B02,"Understand that there are 2 types of compassion. Tender compassion is a more commonly seen compassion, where the people generate immediate sympathetic feelings towards some unfortunate events. Another form of compassion, which goes beyond initial sympathetic feeling, and wanted to do more sustainable and systematically to alleviate the situation, would be known as foresighted compassion. Do you need an example?",
13,sat part 1,B03,This is fine! This is exactly the reason this chatbot is created! We aim to develop compassion for you! Let us begin! ,
14,sat part 1,B04,"To feel compassionate towards the child, we have to first become intimate with our child. Let us practice exercises 1, and 2 (to recall early memories, and become intimate with the childhood self).",
15,sat part 1,B05,Do you form a closer connection with the child?,
16,sat part 1,B06,"Amazing! You have accomplished the first goal! However, we are still not exactly there. Are you ready to take the relationship with the child self to the next level? ",
17,sat part 1,B07,"Okay, shall we do ESA or end the session?",
18,sat part 1,B08,"Now that you feel you have successfully formed a closer connection with the child, time to show your childhood self some love! Let us practice exercises 3, 4 and 5 (singing, expressing love, pledging to care for and support the childhood self)",
19,sat part 1,B09,Do you feel love and a stronger urge to protect your child now? ,
20,sat part 1,B10,"Congratulations! You have shown tender compassion! This is a great first stage of compassion, where you have shown sympathy towards the child! Now, let us extend to see what to do with this compassion.",
21,sat part 2,C01,"What kind of compassion do you feel towards your childhood self? Is that tender compassion which is an immediate sympathy towards the child, or is that foresighted compassion, where you help to make the child grow for the long term?",
22,sat part 2,C02,"Great first step! You are already ahead of most people by having compassion as part of you! Now, let us take a step further by practicing some SAT protocols.",
23,sat part 2,C03,"You have shown tender compassion towards the childhood self. Now, try to shift that compassion and project that compassion feeling towards a vulnerable community. Close your eyes, and think about a vulnerable community (If you need ideas, go to AUC).",
24,sat part 2,C04,Do you feel like you should help them?,
25,sat part 2,C05,"Why is that? Do you feel like they do not deserve some help, or you can't feel compassion for them?",
26,sat part 2,C06,"Let us take a step back, and try to form an intimate relationship with our childhood self.",
27,sat part 2,C07,"Let us take a step back. With the tender compassion that you have developed towards your childhood self, try to do exercise 15 (to change perspective).",
28,sat part 2,C08,"Now close your eyes, and imagine that you're part of that vulnerable community. Do you feel that you deserve some help?",
29,sat part 2,C09,"There must be something deeper that leads to their position of them as vulnerable communities today. Think deeper. Now, do you want to help them?",
30,sat part 2,C10,Now back to your own self. Do you feel like you should help the vulnerable community?,
31,sat part 3,D01,"Great! If you believe that you have shown the trait of foresighted compassion, is it okay if still do some protocols to see how are we doing?",
32,sat part 3,D02,Let us do exercise 8. ,
33,sat part 4,E01,How do you feel like you should help them?,
34,sat part 4,E02,"Congratulations! You have shown foresighted compassion, where you expect the child to deal with the situation maturely. You have developed the capability to develop long-term sustainable solutions. Let us move to MAIN NODE to make meaningful actions.",
35,sat part 4,E03,"Now think about this. Sometimes children make unreasonable requests. When they don't get it, they will be upset. It is the responsibility of our adult self to teach them to bear with it, and deal with the situation with maturity. Let us practice exercises 17 and 18 (Identifying personal resentments and committing to constructive actions)",
36,sat part 4,E04,"Do you feel that the best sort of action is perhaps not something you immediately think of or something that the child want, rather, it could be a more difficult activity that requires discipline or maturity?",
37,sat part 4,E05,Congratulations! You have shown foresighted compassion. Now it is time to practice it! Head to AUC so that you can do something meaningful! Head to MAIN NODE.,
38,sat part 5,F01,There might be some form of anti-social behavior exhibited. Let us dives a little bit deeper.,
39,sat part 5,F02,Do you have some personal resentments towards someone you know?,
40,sat part 5,F03,"Do you care about things that are happening around you? For example, friends, families?",
41,sat part 5,F04,Do you know what is happening in your local community? Have you joined any local activities?,
42,sat part 5,F05,Do you care about events happening on the other side of the world?,
43,sat part 5,F06,Great! Do you feel compassionate towards events happening on the other side of the world?,
44,sat part 5,F07,Amazing! Now let us go back to the question about vulnerable communities. ,
45,sat part 5,F08,"There is a different degree of anti-social behavior. Let us take some time to act it out. Practice exercises 17, 18 (Identifying personal resentments and planning more constructive actions).",
46,sat part 5,F09,​​Do you feel you care a little bit more about social environments?,
47,esa,G01,Do you follow through last week actions? How do you feel?,
48,auc part 1,H01,"Welcome to AUC. To begin, please choose a news category from the following",
49,auc part 1,H02,How do you feel after reading the story?,
50,auc part 1,H03,Why don't you feel anything?,
51,auc part 1,H04,Maybe the compassion trait is not yet fully developed. And we need to practice SAT a little more. Let us move back to SAT protocols.,
52,auc part 1,H05,"If you feel bad for the unfortunate, and feel that you want to help that person with a more short term solutions, you have shown tender compassion towards the victim! It is a good start that you want to help them!",
53,auc part 1,H06,Let us do a quick test. Which of the following solutions would be a form of foresighted compassion for climate change?,
54,auc part 1,H07,"This is a great start.  However, notes that the solution that you have selected is not scalable and sustainable. Reducing electricity usage, and reducing plastic bag usage on your own initiative is a purely voluntary action. The impact of these actions will be very limited given the scale of its nature. This is a form of tender compassion, where you try to help, but the impact of the action is limited. On the other hand, pressuring governments to encourage green energy-related investments, and crafting policies that enforce carbon-neutral might be more sustainable solutions! This form of compassion that requires deeper thinking to solve the problem from a more global, sustainable, and systematic basis is foresighted compassion.",
55,auc part 1,H08,"Congratulations on being compassionate! Now that you are clear on the difference between tender compassion and foresighted compassion, try to think and research how you can solve the problem that you have in mind with foresighted compassion. Come back in a week.",
56,auc part 2,I01,Have you research through existing solutions?,
57,auc part 2,I02,"It's okay. Please set a new deadline to yourself, and come back.",
58,auc part 2,I03,Is there a reasonably good solution?,
59,auc part 2,I04,"Think about how do you plan to achieve this. When thinking, please consider the long-term impact that can potentially be changed (Foresighted compassion requires in-depth and sustainable solutions). Write down a detailed plan.",
60,auc part 3,J01,Have you follow through your solution?,
61,auc part 3,J02,Try to reflect on what went wrong in the second stage. ,
62,auc part 3,J03,"Please find a partner that can complete the solution together with you, and hold each other accountable. Start today.",
63,auc part 3,J04,What do you feel about your compassion energy? Write down how you feel about them.,
64,auc part 3,J05,"Write down a blog post sharing your success story. Discuss your ideas, actions, commitments, what you learn from, and the feeling about compassion energy.  Share them to the forum!",
